# Implementing from a Plan

Treat the plan as a living document that tracks both progress and deviations.

## Tracking Progress

Check off items in the plan as you complete them. Replace `- [ ]` with `- [x]` for:
- Individual tasks within phases
- Success criteria after verification

This provides real-time visibility into what's done and what remains.

## Handling Deviations

Deviations happen when you or the user want to change approach during implementation.

**When deviations occur:**
1. Present the proposed change and reasoning to the user
2. Get approval
3. Update the plan file to reflect the new approach
4. Document why it changed (inline note or modifications section)

**Common reasons:**
- Better approach discovered
- Blockers found
- Scope adjustments
- User preference changes

**Documentation style:**
- Add `> **Modified YYYY-MM-DD**: [reason]` notes at relevant sections
- Or maintain a "Plan Modifications" section
- Strike through removed items with explanation: `~~item~~ (removed: reason)`

## Plan vs TodoWrite

- **Plan**: Long-term record, persists across sessions, full context
- **TodoWrite**: Ephemeral work tracking, session-specific, current task status

Use both: Load TodoWrite from current phase, mark items complete in both places.

## Summary Document

The implementation summary should link to the plan and note any significant deviations in the "Implementation Notes" section.
