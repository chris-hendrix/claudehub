# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Turn rough ideas into fully formed designs through natural collaborative dialogue.

## Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions. Each answer informs the next question.
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Bounded options accelerate decisions. Open-ended is fine for exploratory topics.
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Challenge every feature. Remove unnecessary complexity from all designs.
- **Explore alternatives** - Always consider 2-3 approaches before settling on one.
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each before continuing.
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense.

## Questioning

Focus on understanding purpose, constraints, and success criteria. Prefer multiple choice questions - they're easier to answer and keep momentum. Reserve open-ended questions for genuinely exploratory topics.

Sequential questioning maintains focus. Avoid question dumps.

## Exploring Approaches

Present 2-3 different approaches with their trade-offs. Lead with the recommended option and explain why. Frame trade-offs conversationally.

Common approach patterns:
- **Minimal** - Smallest viable solution (quick validation, low risk)
- **Balanced** - Pragmatic middle ground (most use cases)
- **Comprehensive** - Full-featured solution (long-term investment)

## Presenting Designs

Break designs into digestible sections (200-300 words each). Validate understanding after each segment before proceeding. Cover architecture, components, data flow, error handling, and testing as relevant.
