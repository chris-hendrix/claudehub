# Researching Web

Methodology for conducting effective web research and synthesizing findings.

## Philosophy

- **Accuracy first** - Verify claims across multiple sources before presenting
- **Always cite** - Every finding must link back to its source
- **Source hierarchy** - Official docs > reputable technical sources > community content
- **Currency awareness** - Note publication dates; flag potentially outdated information
- **Multi-angle coverage** - Explore topics from multiple search angles for completeness

## Research Types

| Type | Purpose | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Searching** | Find relevant sources | WebSearch |
| **Synthesizing** | Extract and organize findings | WebFetch |

Choose the appropriate type based on what's needed. They are typically combined: search first, then synthesize from the best results.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Query Analysis** - Deconstruct request, identify key terms, plan multiple search angles
2. **Strategic Searches** - Broad to specific, use site-specific targeting, vary query phrasing
3. **Content Retrieval** - Fetch most promising results, prioritize authoritative sources
4. **Synthesis** - Organize by relevance, cite sources, highlight conflicts, note gaps

See [searching-web](references/searching-web.md) for steps 1-2 and [synthesizing-page](references/synthesizing-page.md) for steps 3-4.

For query-type-specific strategies, see [query-strategies](references/query-strategies.md).

## Output Structure

Structure findings by purpose:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Summary | 2-3 sentence key takeaways |
| Detailed Findings | Topic sections with source attribution |
| Sources | Links with descriptions |
| Gaps/Limitations | Unresolved questions, outdated info |

Always include source links. Flag conflicting information explicitly.
